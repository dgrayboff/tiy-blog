## Halfway Through Lecture -- A Reflection

It's amazing how much I've learned since Day 1, and equally as amazing is how much information I've retained and remember week to week. A lot of concepts are cumulative and if I didn't fully understand something, there's a decent chance I'll run into it later on and then fully grasp the concept with further practice. One thing I didn't know much about before The Iron Yard was jQuery. I'd hear all about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and more, but didn't know too much about the legendary jQuery.  

It's incredible how powerful this JavaScript library/tool is, and it's very interesting to see how jQuery can really make your code more efficient and easier to read than vanilla JS. Some functions that took 10 lines of code with vanilla now maybe take 5 or 6 with jQuery. That said, I'm very glad that we covered vanilla JS prior to jumping into jQuery, as I feel like it helped me gain a better understanding of the base concepts and how things run with jQuery. Initially, when we were introduced to jQuery, I was a bit overwhelmed because it felt like a new language and I didn't see the appeal, but very shortly after I understood how powerful it really is, and do enjoy using it. But it's also nice to know that if I wanted to build something in vanilla JS, I'd have the capability to do so.


One challenge I've faced since starting the program is knowing when to move on when I'm stuck. Often times I'll work on the same issue that's getting me caught up for hours and hours with not much progress. During that time I will test a bunch of different ways to get to where I want to go, and even if they don't work, at least I'm trying something and exploring/learning more. However, sometimes I need to recognize that it's best to move on to something else, or work on another problem, or take a break -- before coming back to the original issue. Sometimes going for a long walk is all I need to reset my mind and be able to come back in and tackle something in the correct manner. Or, if I know I have a couple features to figure out, occasionally moving on to another one then coming back is helpful in figuring it out. Overall, everything is a learning experience here, and I'm continually figuring out the best ways to succeed.
