## The Growth Mindset

Dr. Carol Dweck's research on what she calls the “Growth Mindset” argues that an individual can learn anything they want if they truly put in the effort to do so. Dweck believes that if students engage in a problem deeply, they’ll better succeed in the end. When someone gets a question wrong and they struggle to come up with the solution, their brain is actually growing in a positive way. With a Growth Mindset, you can achieve more than those with a Fixed Mindset.

A Fixed Mindset is based around an individual’s desire to be intelligent in every situation but not put in the necessary effort and devotion to learning. Those with a fixed mindset compare themselves to their peers and think of a situation in terms of their probability to fail. They don’t take well to constructive criticism and if they’re frustrated by a problem, often give up. Fixed mindset individuals avoid challenges and feel threatened by the success of others.

Those with a Growth Mindset, on the other hand, find inspiration and value in the success of others. They embrace challenges, learn from criticism, work hard to reach their goals, and see a parallel between effort and success.

Personally, I’ve seen myself present in both categories — Growth and Fixed Mindsets. Even if it’s not your intention, I think it’s natural to display many of the qualities of a Fixed Mindset. However, if I’m personally invested in something, and want to really succeed, I definitely lean towards a Growth Mindset. I think that being truly interested in an idea or concept organically pulls you towards a Growth Mindset as you have a desire to learn and grow.

After one week at The Iron Yard, I’ve already seen myself expressing characteristics geared towards a Growth Mindset. I walked into this program with a  desire to learn and succeed, and that has pushed me towards a healthy learning experience. I’ve naturally put in the effort and practice necessary to learn the material and build a project as I’m personally invested in becoming a successful developer. Nobody has forced me to enroll at The Iron Yard, nor has anybody forced me to complete my assignments. I’m very interested in increasing my knowledge and skills through this process, and believe that if I put in the time, effort and dedication to this program, I’ll come out with a positive growth experience.
