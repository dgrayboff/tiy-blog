## Tutorial - How to Use a For Loop in JavaScript

*Challenge: Using JavaScript, print all numbers from 0 to 20, and display which numbers are either odd or even.*

A typical **For** loop in JavaScript takes three statements: the first decides where the loop will start, the second says how long the loop will run for, and the third defines how the integer changes.

* Here's an example:
```
for (i = 1; i < 10; i++)
```

What the above statement says in plain English is: The loop will start at one, loop until i is less than 10, and increase by a positive 1 integer each time.

After you set the statements, you'll then want to choose what piece of code to run during the loop. This comes after the statements and between a pair of curly braces.

Looking back at the challenge above, if we want to print all numbers from 0 to 20, we can set the start and end of the loop like this:

```
 for (i = 0; i <=20; i++)
 ```

i (this variable can be anything, but is usually "i" in examples) starts at zero and ends at 20, since it's less than or *equal* to 20. It increase by 1 each time.

The code to return would say:
```
if (i % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(i + " is even");
  }
  else {
    console.log(i + " is odd");
  }
};
```

What we have above is: if i, which loops, is divisible by 2 (since i % 2 === 0 shows that 2 goes into the integer with zero remaining) and therefore even, then log to the console i plus the string " is even". If i isn't divisible by 2, then log to the console i plus the string " is odd".

The final code looks like this:

```
for (var i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {  
	if (i % 2 === 0) {  
		console.log(i + " is even");  
	}  
	else {  
		console.log(i + " is odd");  
	}  
}
```

>> 0 is even  
>> 1 is odd  
>> 2 is even  
>> 3 is odd  
>> 4 is even  
...

All the way to 20!

Congrats, you just learned how to create a for loop!
