## Pair Programming

Pair Programming is essentially when two programmers work together at a single computer to accomplish a task as a pair. The concept argues that a pair working together at a single monitor results in higher quality material than a pair working separately at their own computers. Cooperation is key, and striving in this sort of environment can take time and patience. Overall, it shouldn't feel like one person is teaching/mentoring the other, as it should be a collaborative work experience.

One of the styles of pair programming is the Driver-Navigator style. In this situation, the Driver has the keyboard and controls the input, while the Navigator pays strong attention to what's being entered and helps make sure the Driver is going in the right direction. It's recommended that the programmers switch roles often to contribute to the collaborative environment. Ping-Pong Pairing is another form which involves both programmers controlling the input-- the first writes test code, and the other tries to get that code to work and pass tests. If only one member has experience writing coding tests, then Driver-Navigator might be the better option.
