## Tutorial - jQuery click events!

This blog post is going to cover how to use jQuery for click events in JavaScript. jQuery makes a lot of processes in JS easier and more efficient (less lines of code!).

In order to use jQuery to interact with an HTML element on your page, you can use the .on function built in to jQuery. There are a few .on events you can use, such as 'click' or 'submit'. Here's an example:

```
$('.input-class').on('submit', function(){  
  // execute this code upon submit     
  })
```

Above is the basic syntax of a jQuery .on event. This code is saying to take the class of a specific input and make it so when the user submits (such as for a text box), a function will occur (this is what will go between the curly braces).

Instead of a submit event, you can also have something like a 'click' event:

```
$('.input-class').on('click', function(){  
  // execute this code upon submit     
  })
```

All that changed was taking the first argument for .on and changing to click. Click is helpful for elements like nested accordions, tabs, clicking images, and more.

The first part of the code after jQuery's '$' is declaring what element you'll make the .on event for (what you'll manipulate).
